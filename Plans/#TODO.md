Awesome footage from great height

### First Iteration

Tried everything from scratch. Important lesson in manufacturing. Don't reinvent the wheel _unless necessary_

Learnt to find people, learn and teach. Help and be helped

Started simple and "cheap"

Spent time and money in R&D

F450

First bought ESCs and motors. Tried FC on an Arduino, self made FW. Didn't work as expected

Tried making TX

KK2.1

Flysky Radio

Cheap BLDC motors

### Second Iteration

TBS Discovery clone

Pixhawk, old motors, SimonK Yellow ESCs

Pixhawk, new motors, SimonK Red ESCs

Valuable lesson in soldering by damaging a 3k 4 in 1 ESCs.

Crash

2* GPS
GPS Blending

Crash

Troubleshooting

Half a mile crash

Upgrade control link

### Third Iteration

Break planned but No break taken. Decided to build a micro

Decided not fun ðŸ˜¢

### Fourth Iteration

FPV Split Camera

VTX

FPV Screen

Got rid of Pixhawk

Betaflight, CLRacing F7

Radiomaster TX12

Crash ðŸ˜¢

FC Shorted

Flywoo Mr Croc 7inch

New motors

Reluctancy to step down size

ExpressLRS

Trying out FPV

Liftoff

Crash due to video loss

Drone regulations

### Fifth Iteration

Currently planned

Full FPV Setup and all that stuff

One iNav Quad planned too...
